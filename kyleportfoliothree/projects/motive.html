                    <p>Patient adherence is widely problematic in the medical field and physical therapy is no exception. Failure to complete exercises as prescribed slows a patient's recovery, wastes money and causes lasting health consequences. With the help of Premera Blue Cross, this project addressed:
                    
                    <p>How can I motivate adult physical therapy patients with acute, orthopedic injuries to adhere to their home exercise programs?

The patient would visit a physical therapy clinic, be expected to complete their exercises at home, and return for assessments until they were healthy enough to stop.

Testing through a scenario based, semi-structured interview allowed us to have participants interact directly with our prototypes in an imagined context (i.e. at the clinic, in their living room).

                    <p>Ultimately, Motive succeeded in adding value to the physical therapy experience by empowering patients to take ownership of their recovery, providing confidence building reference materials, visualizing progress and breaking up the monotony of physical therapy -- as confirmed by experts and physical therapy patients. Unlike existing products, Motive accomplishes all of these objectives without requiring additional work on the part of physical therapists.
